## What It Does

This app helps general contractors:

- Organize and manage multiple construction projects
- Create calculators within each project to handle:
  - Square footage estimation
  - Line-by-line pricing
  - Descriptive breakdowns of work
- Rename or delete projects and calculators on the fly
- Eventually generate a printable document containing all bid totals and details

The goal is to replace handwritten bids with a digital, streamlined tool that saves time and improves accuracy.

---

## Current Status
- Core functionality like project and calculator management is fully functional.
- The user interface is basic and visually unpolished, with improvements planned.
- User authentication is planned and Firebase is set up, but not yet integrated.
- Additional features like printable bid summaries and import/export templates are on the roadmap.
- ESLint is configured to help maintain code quality.
- The app is manually tested regularly to ensure features work as expected; formal unit and integration tests are planned for future development.

## Features

- Create, rename, and delete projects
- Per-project calculators for:
  - Square footage calculation
  - Price calculation
  - Description fields
- Automatic calculation of totals per calculator
- Future feature: A Totals page combining all calculator data into a bid-ready document
- Data stored and synced with Firestore (Firebase)
- Deployed via Vercel

## What I Learned
- Understand and implement real-time database operations with Firebase Firestore
- Build nested state systems for dynamic calculators
- Structure React apps using reusable components and router-based navigation
- Collaborate with a real client to solve practical problems for the construction industry

## Roadmap
- Add more calculator types (e.g, materials, labor, mobilization)
- Provide default Firebase seed data to simplify setup for other users
- Improve UI styling and layout consistency
- Authentication with user roles
- Totals page with combined project summary
- Print-to-PDF functionality
