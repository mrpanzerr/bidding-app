A streamlined bidding tool built for general contractors. This project replaces the slow, error-prone process of handwritten estimates with a faster, digital alternative. Built from the ground up to reflect how real contractors think, work, and price.

## What It Does

This app helps general contractors:

- Manage multiple construction projects at once  
- Create custom calculators within each project for:
  - Square footage and price estimates  
  - Descriptions and work breakdowns  
  - Real-time total calculations  
- Rename or delete projects and calculators instantly  
- Generate a printable bid-ready document with full cost breakdown.
  - This includes PDF and Excel exports of project total breakdown, material list and labor estimations.

Itâ€™s built to feel familiar to contractors â€” simple, clear, and focused â€” while saving them hours of manual work.
